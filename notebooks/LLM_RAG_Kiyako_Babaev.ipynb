            "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sentence_transformers/models/Dense.py:63: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

Main Question: How to treat pneumonia?\\nASSISTANT: The treatment of pneumonia depends on the underlying cause, severity of the disease, and the patient\\'s overall health status. In general, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for bacterial pneumonia. The choice of antibiotic depends on the suspected bacterial pathogen and the patient\\'s medical history. In cases of severe or refractory pneumonia, hospitalization and intensive care may be necessary. Supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and fluid replacement, may also be required. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to remove any obstructions or to repair damaged lung tissue. It is important to follow the treatment plan prescribed by a healthcare provider and to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished.'"

bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It can range from a mild to a severe illness, and can affect people of all ages and backgrounds. Symptoms of pneumonia can include cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for pneumonia depends on the underlying cause and can include antibiotics, rest, and hydration. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary. Prevention measures include getting vaccinated, washing hands regularly, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.'"

For bacterial pneumonia, antibiotics are typically prescribed. The type of antibiotic prescribed will depend on the specific bacteria causing the infection. For viral pneumonia, antibiotics are not effective and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. This may include rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for further treatment and monitoring. It is important to follow the treatment plan prescribed by a healthcare provider and complete the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished.'"

It can range from a mild to a severe illness, and can affect people of all ages and backgrounds. Symptoms of pneumonia can include cough, fever, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for pneumonia depends on the underlying cause and can include antibiotics, rest, and hydration. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary. Prevention measures include getting vaccinated, washing hands regularly, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.\\nUSER: How to treat it?\\nASSISTANT: Pneumonia is a lung infection caused by various types of bacteria, viruses, or fungi.

Treatment for pneumonia depends on the underlying cause and can include antibiotics, rest, and hydration. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary. Prevention measures include getting vaccinated, washing hands regularly, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.\\nUSER: How to treat it?\\nASSISTANT: The treatment for pneumonia depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the illness. For bacterial pneumonia, antibiotics are typically prescribed. The type of antibiotic prescribed will depend on the specific bacteria causing the infection. For viral pneumonia, antibiotics are not effective and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. This may include rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers and cough suppressants. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for further treatment and monitoring. It is important to follow the treatment plan prescribed by a healthcare provider and complete the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished.\\nUSER: What is the most common cause of pneumonia?\\nASSISTANT: The most common cause of pneumonia is a bacterial infection, specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, pneumonia can also be caused by viruses, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as fungi and other microorganisms. The severity of pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and it can affect people of all ages and backgrounds.\\nUSER: How to avoid this disease?\\nASSISTANT: There are several ways to help avoid pneumonia:\\n\\n1. Get vaccinated: There are several vaccines available that can help protect against pneumonia caused by certain bacteria and viruses.\\n2. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently, especially after coughing or sneezing, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.\\n3. Avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can weaken your immune system and increase your risk of developing pneumonia.\\n4. Stay healthy: Eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep to help keep your immune system strong.\\n5. Protect yourself during outbreaks: If there is an outbreak of pneumonia in your community, avoid areas where the disease is spreading and follow the advice of public health officials.\\n\\n']"
